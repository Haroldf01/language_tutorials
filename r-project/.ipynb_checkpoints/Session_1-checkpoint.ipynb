    "# Evolution of R\n",
    "\n",
    "R was initially written by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Department of Statistics of the University of Auckland in Auckland, New Zealand. R made its first appearance in 1993.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A large group of individuals has contributed to R by sending code and bug reports.\n",
    "- Since mid-1997 there has been a core group (the \"R Core Team\") who can modify the R source code archive.\n",

    "# Features of R\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated earlier, R is a programming language and software environment for statistical analysis, graphics representation and reporting. The following are the important features of R −\n",
    "\n",
    "- R is a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n",
    "- R has an effective data handling and storage facility,\n",
    "- R provides a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, lists, vectors and matrices.\n",
    "- R provides a large, coherent and integrated collection of tools for data analysis.\n",
    "- R provides graphical facilities for data analysis and display either directly at the computer or printing at the papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a conclusion, R is world’s most widely used statistics programming language.\n",
