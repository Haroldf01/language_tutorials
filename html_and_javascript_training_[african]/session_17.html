    <h2>Javascript Arrays</h2>

    <p>In JavaScript, an array is an ordered list of values. Each value is called an element specified by an index:</p>

    <p>A JavaScript array has the following characteristics:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>First, an array can hold values of mixed types. For example, you can have an array that stores elements with the types number, string, boolean, and null.</li>
        <li>Second, the size of an array is dynamic and auto-growing. In other words, you donâ€™t need to specify the array size up front.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Loops</h2>

    <p>A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</p>
    <p>Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>There are three different loop statements are there in Javascript. They are as follows:</li>
        <li>while</li>
        <li>do...while</li>
        <li>for</li>
    </ol>
