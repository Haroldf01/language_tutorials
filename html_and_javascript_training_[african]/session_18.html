    <h2>Javascript Loops</h2>

    <p>A loop is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached.</p>
    <p>Typically, a certain process is done, such as getting an item of data and changing it, and then some condition is checked such as whether a counter has reached a prescribed number.</p>

    <ol>
        <li>There are three different loop statements are there in Javascript. They are as follows:</li>
        <li>while</li>
        <li>do...while</li>
        <li>for</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>While Loop</h2>
    <p>The JavaScript <b>while</b> statement creates a loop that executes a block as long as a condition evaluates to <b>true</b>.</p>

    <p>The while statement evaluates the <b>expression</b> before each iteration of the loop.</p>

    <p>If the <u>expression evaluates to true</u>, the while statement executes the statement. Otherwise, the <u>while loop exits</u>.</p>

    <p>Because the while loop evaluates the expression before each iteration, it is known as a <i>pretest</i> loop.</p>

    <p>If the expression evaluates to false before the loop enters, the while loop will never execute.</p>

    <p>The following flowchart illustrates the <b>while</b> loop statement:</p>
